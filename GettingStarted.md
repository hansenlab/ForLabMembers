# Getting started in the Hansen lab

## Immediate actions

1. Get access to the cluster resources we use, currently JHPCE.  This requires scheduling an orientation (which can be attended remotely) to get a username, and introduction to the resource.
2. Get appropriate permissions on the cluster resources; you may have to be added to the right permission groups.
3. Get a username on GitHub and make sure that you're added as a member of the hansenlab organization (this requires that you tell us your GitHub username).
4. Get a username on Bitbucket.
5. When you get a Hopkins emails address add it to your GitHub / Bitbucket account.  Both organizations provide a lot of free resources for people with edu email addresses.
6. If you're involved in writing papers, get an account on (Overleaf)[http://www.overleaf.com].
