# Getting started in the Hansen lab

## Accounts

1. Get access to the cluster resources we use, currently JHPCE.  This requires scheduling an orientation (which can be attended remotely) to get a username, and introduction to the resource.
2. Get appropriate permissions on the cluster resources; you may have to be added to the right permission groups.
3. Get a username on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and make sure that you're added as a member of the hansenlab organization (this requires that you tell us your GitHub username).
4. Get a username on [Bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.com).
5. When you get a Hopkins emails address, add it to your GitHub / Bitbucket account and request an educational discount.  Both organizations provide a lot of free resources for people with edu email addresses.
6. If you're involved in writing papers, get an account on [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com).

## Computing setup

1. Setup ssh-keys on the cluster, to make it easy to login.
2. Setup a `.sge_request` file for job submission on the cluster.


## Tools

1. Learn the basis of Git. FIXME: add link to good intro guide.
