# Getting started in the Hansen lab

## Accounts

Some of these things requires other people (us) to take action, but usually you need to send us appropriate username(s).

1. Get access to the cluster resources we use, currently JHPCE.  This requires scheduling an orientation (which can be attended remotely) to get a username, and introduction to the resource.
2. Get appropriate permissions on the cluster resources; you may have to be added to the right permission groups.
3. Get a username on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and make sure that you're added as a member of the hansenlab organization (this requires that you tell us your GitHub username).
4. Get a username on [Bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.com). We are using Bitbucket a bit less these days, but some projects still exists there and Bitbucket has more generous user limits than GitHub.
5. When you get a Hopkins emails address, add it to your GitHub / Bitbucket account and request an educational discount.  Both organizations provide a lot of free resources for people with edu email addresses.
6. If you're involved in writing papers, get an account on [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com).
7. Get access to our Google Calendar.
8. Make sure you're subscribed to the right email lists (currently: Joint meeting).
9. Get added to the [Lab](http://www.hansenlab.org) webpage.

## Computing setup

1. Setup ssh-keys on the cluster, to make it easy to login.
2. Setup a `.sge_request` file for job submission on the cluster.
3. Understand which version of R corresponds to Bioconductor devel and Bioconductor stable, so you're using the right version of R.

## Tools

1. Learn the basis of Git. FIXME: add link to good intro guide.
